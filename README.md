# Unclear Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue with error handling in MATLAB functions.  The `myFunction` function provides a generic error message which could be improved to give the user more context.

The goal is to show how providing more specific information in error messages can significantly improve the debugging experience.
